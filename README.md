# Brain Tumor Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression


## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for a research project on Brain Tumor Detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression. The primary objective of this project is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection from MRI images.

## Motivation

Brain tumors are a significant health concern, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. Currently, manual inspection of MRI images is the standard practice, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. Automating this process using machine learning techniques can aid healthcare professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Problem Description

Detecting brain tumors in MRI images is challenging due to the complexity and variability in tumor appearances. This project addresses the need for a reliable and automated tumor detection system.

## Proposed System

Our approach involves the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess MRI images to enhance features and reduce noise.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed images.
3. **Classification**: Utilize SVM and Logistic Regression algorithms for tumor classification.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Dataset

We used the [MRI Brain Tumor Dataset](https://www.medicaldata.cloud/data-sets/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/) for training and testing our models. This dataset contains 1220 MRI images categorized into two classes: no tumor and pituitary.
